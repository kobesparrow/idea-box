## IdeaBoxTriples
---


#### Authors:
Mark Collins and Kayla Lawson. 


#### Built with:
* HTML
* CSS 
* Vanilla Javascript

This project relied heavily on JavaScript. We were able to create the UI with a limited amount of HTML. This was styled with CSS  and is fully responsive for large screens and mobile.

#### Project requirements:
Build an idea generator to create idea cards that can be stored, deleted, rated and searched. With each idea being displayed in cards on the webpage, you have the ability to edit after you save an idea which gives the user the ability to change the original idea.

#### Goals:
Provide a fluid and responsive client-side interface which relies on JavaScript, specifically localStorage, to persist ideas between sessions.

* Build a responsive client-side application.
* Implement client-side data persistence using localStorage.
* Iterate over dom elements in order to filter what is being displayed.
* Give user ability to delete ideas from DOM and local storage.
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness.
